# JointMove

The code for my robot control system.
Cannot run due to absence of robot.
See JointMoveProto.cpp for the majority of the code.



I didn't write the tserial class, but the rest is my work. Use it as you like. If you happen to own one of these robots, you can probably get more out of it than I can.
